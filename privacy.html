            At WorkApps, we value your privacy and are committed to protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy applies to all our products, and it explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information.

            What information do we collect?
            
            We do not store your data (inputs, clicks, or email messages). All data stays on Google's servers. Granting us access to your data does not allow us to access it offline. This access is only used for displaying your information on the app and for taking actions on your behalf. All the actions performed come from you.
            The only information we store from your Google account is your email id.
            
            How do we use your information?
            
            We use your information to provide and improve our services. Specifically, we use your name, last name, profile picture, and email to display your information on the app. We do not share your data with any third party.
            
            We adhere to Google's API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements, which means that we only use and transfer information received from Google APIs for the purpose of providing and improving our services.
            
            How do we protect your information?
            
            We take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We use industry-standard encryption technologies to ensure that your data is protected while it is being transmitted to us and stored on our servers.
            
            Your rights and choices
            
            You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information. You can do this by contacting us at support@workapps.xyz. We will respond to your request within a reasonable time.
            
            You can also control what information we collect from your Google account by managing your permissions on the Google Permissions page.
            
            Changes to this Privacy Policy
            
            We reserve the right to modify this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website prior to the effective date of the changes. Your continued use of our Addon after the effective date of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy.
