This Privacy Policy applies to all our products, current and upcoming, and it explains how we collect, use, and disclose your information. </p> <h3 class="dark:text-gray-400 font-bold leading-7 mt-6 text-gray-500 text-lg"> What information do we collect? </h3> <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-gray-500 text-lg"> We do not store your data (email messages, drive files etc.). All data stays on Google's servers. Granting us access to your data does not allow us to access it offline. This access is only used for displaying your information on the app and for taking actions on your behalf. All the actions performed come from you. The only information we store from your Google account is your email id, which is recorded when you access our services/products for the first time. </p> <h3 class="dark:text-gray-400 font-bold leading-7 mt-6 text-gray-500 text-lg"> How do we use your information? </h3> <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-gray-500 text-lg"> When you send a request, we log information related to each request. Any private information which was not created while making the request is not stored. For example, when you request to generate a reply to an email with a given prompt, we do not store the email content or who sent that email, but we store information related to what prompt was provided by the user. We use this information to improve our services. <br><br> We do not share your data with any third party. <br><br> We adhere to Google's API Services User Data Policy, including the Limited Use requirements, which means that we only use and transfer information received from Google APIs for the purpose of providing and improving our services. </p> <h3 class="dark:text-gray-400 font-bold leading-7 mt-6 text-gray-500 text-lg"> How do we protect your information? </h3> <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-gray-500 text-lg"> We take appropriate security measures to protect your personal information from unauthorized access, alteration, disclosure, or destruction. We use industry-standard encryption technologies to ensure that your data is protected while it is being transmitted to us and stored on our servers. </p> <h3 class="dark:text-gray-400 font-bold leading-7 mt-6 text-gray-500 text-lg"> Your rights and choices </h3> <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-gray-500 text-lg"> You have the right to access, correct, or delete your personal information.

If we make material changes to this Privacy Policy, we will notify you by email or by posting a notice on our website prior to the effective date of the changes. Your continued use of our products after the effective date of the changes constitutes your acceptance of the new Privacy Policy. </p> <h3 class="dark:text-gray-400 font-bold leading-7 mt-6 text-gray-500 text-lg"> Contact us </h3> <p class="dark:text-gray-400 text-gray-500 text-lg"> If you have any questions or concerns about this Privacy Policy, please contact us at support@workapps.xyz.
